Deletes unused language, redundant fonts, proofing tools, bug reporting apps from Office v15.15 (and maybe future versions)

# more info
For Office 2016 **v15.15** (and maybe future versions?)

With this script, you'll get rid of : 
* Unused applications languages,
* Redundant fonts inside Office applications packages,
* Redundant Proofing tools languages
* Microsoft bug reporting applications.
You'll be able to select one of those actions, on each application... Or all of them, on all installed Office softwares ! At the end, it will tell you how much disk space you've saved.

DON'T USE ON VERSIONS BEFORE OFFICE 2016 v15.15 released in October 2015, license will break.

As usual, this software is delivered as is.

Worse case scenario, you'll have to reinstall Office (no complaint up to now :) )

This script can easily be improved, do not hesitate :)
